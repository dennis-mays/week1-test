                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Dennis and I have over 30 years of IT support and
                    management experience. During that time I have done
                    everything from technical support to designing a network
                    solution for a multi-million dollar company. I've also been
                    project lead on multiple system and infrustructure upgrades.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also have a creative side as well. Part of my duties
                    included working with our marketing team. In that role I was
                    responsible for producing product catalogs and posters that
                    would be used at various trade shows and retail stores
                    across the country. I also helped with the production of
                    product photography that would be used in various brochures
                    and websites as well as producing weekly promotional emails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly I was part of a team that reviewed and tested
                    ecommerce websites for design and ease of use.
